# âœ… Policy Database Storage Fix

## Problem
Policies were not being saved to the database when:
1. Creating policies through `CreatePolicyDialog` - was using mock API call
2. Applying policies through `PolicyEditor` - only sent blockchain transaction, didn't save to database

## Solution

### 1. Backend: Added POST /api/policies endpoint
- **Location**: `src/backend/server.ts`
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/policies`
- **Features**:
  - Validates vault exists
  - Handles both array and object format for `allowedDex`
  - Automatically deactivates old policies and creates new version
  - Returns complete policy data with version number

### 2. Frontend: Updated CreatePolicyDialog
- **Location**: `src/components/CreatePolicyDialog.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced mock `setTimeout` with real API call to `POST /api/policies`
  - Handles vault address formatting
  - Shows success/error messages
  - Saves wallet address as `setBy`

### 3. Frontend: Updated PolicyEditor
- **Location**: `src/components/PolicyEditor.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - After successful blockchain transaction, saves policy to database
  - Includes transaction hash in database record (`deployedTx`)
  - Shows combined success message with both blockchain and database confirmation
  - Handles database save errors gracefully (doesn't fail if blockchain succeeded)

## How It Works

### Creating a Policy (CreatePolicyDialog)
```
User fills form â†’ POST /api/policies â†’ Prisma â†’ PostgreSQL
                                â†“
                          Creates Policy record
                                â†“
                          Returns policy with version
```

### Applying Policy On-Chain (PolicyEditor)
```
User clicks "Apply Policy" â†’ Blockchain Transaction â†’ Success
                                        â†“
                          POST /api/policies (with tx hash)
                                        â†“
                          Prisma â†’ PostgreSQL
                                        â†“
                          Policy saved with deployedTx
```

## Testing

1. **Test CreatePolicyDialog:**
   ```bash
   # Start backend
   npm run dev:backend
   
   # In UI: Policies page â†’ Create Policy
   # Fill form and submit
   # Check database:
   npm run prisma:studio
   ```

2. **Test PolicyEditor:**
   ```bash
   # In UI: Go to any vault detail page
   # Edit policy settings
   # Click "Apply Policy On-Chain"
   # Approve transaction in MetaMask
   # Check that policy appears in database with transaction hash
   ```

## Database Schema
```sql
Policy {
  id: UUID
  vaultAddress: String (FK)
  policyJson: JSON
  active: Boolean
  version: Int
  setBy: String? (wallet address)
  deployedTx: String? (transaction hash)
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

## Important Notes
- âœ… Policies now persist after page refresh
- âœ… Version tracking (new versions increment automatically)
- âœ… Transaction hashes stored for on-chain policies
- âœ… Old policies are deactivated (not deleted)
- âœ… Vault must exist before creating policy
